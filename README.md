## Description
The Spider-Man Swinging Mechanics Controller is a small project of mine where i tried to implement a comprehensive and realistic swinging mechanics system inspired by the iconic web-slinging abilities of Spider-Man. With this controller, 
you can easily implement dynamic and fluid swinging mechanics in your Unity games, giving players the exhilarating experience of swinging through a virtual cityscape just like Spider-Man.
